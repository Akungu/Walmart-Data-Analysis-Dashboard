#hhObjective
The purpose of this analysis was to study how different factors influence sales for various different Walmart Stores for a continuous period of time – from 2010 to 2012. From the analysis I was able to gain insights into the trend of sales and how these factors affect them. These factors include holiday flag – the presence or absence of a holiday, temperature, fuel price, consumer price index and unemployment rate. 
 The data set collected from 45 Walmart stores contain the following variables:
•	Store: store number
•	Date: Sales week start date
•	Weekly_Sales: Sales
•	Holiday_Flag: Mark on the presence or absence of holiday  
•	Temperature: Air temperature in the region
•	Fuel_Price: Fuel cost in the region
•	CPI: Consumer Price Index
•	Unemployment: Unemployment rate
