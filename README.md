# Introduction
## Objective
The purpose of this analysis was to study how different factors influence sales for various different Walmart Stores for a continuous period of time – from 2010 to 2012. From the analysis I was able to gain insights into the trend of sales and how these factors affect them. These factors include holiday flag – the presence or absence of a holiday, temperature, fuel price, consumer price index and unemployment rate. 
### The data set collected from 45 Walmart stores contain the following variables:
•	Store: store number
•	Date: Sales week start date
•	Weekly_Sales: Sales
•	Holiday_Flag: Mark on the presence or absence of holiday  
•	Temperature: Air temperature in the region
•	Fuel_Price: Fuel cost in the region
•	CPI: Consumer Price Index
•	Unemployment: Unemployment rate

## Configuration
Libraries: All the data manipulation and visualization were performed using Microsoft Excel 2016. 
Dataset: The data set used included variables such as: store, date, Weekly_Sales, Holiday_Flag, Temperature, Fuel_Price, CPI, and Unemployment.
## Data Preprocessing
The data was cleaned before starting the analysis by removing duplicate values, filling in missing values and converting data to other data types (data type conversions) and sorting. This was to ensure that the data was uniform before analyzing it and to help understand the structure of the data. 
I then explored the data to find out how many rows and columns the data set contained.
Feature Engineering
## Data Features: Extracted additional information from date by extracting the date and month so as to provide insights into sales trends over yearly quarters for the period of the 3 years.
## Data Analysis
Different charts were used to visualize the data and draw meaning from them. 
Bar charts and pie chart were used to visualize categorical variables of numerical data.
Correlation table was used to measure the strength and direction of relationships between variables.
Line charts were used to show trends between different variables over a continuous period of time.
